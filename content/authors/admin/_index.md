I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Maryland advised by Prof. Tom Goldstein and I am interested in building machine learning solutions for practical applications.

My PhD research focuses on various topics in machine learning ranging from fairness and robustness of face recognition systems to tabular deep learning. 
I did two internships at Amazon, in 2021 I developed NLP solution to monitor integrity and transparency of third-party Alexa Skills at Alexa Monitoring team and in 2022 I worked on improving Alexa Voice Search on FireTV at Alexa Entertainment team. 

Prior to my PhD I received bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Higher School of Economics (Moscow) and master’s degree in computational biology from University College London (London).
