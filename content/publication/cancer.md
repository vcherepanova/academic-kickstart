abstract = "An accurate and simple risk prediction model that would facilitate earlier detection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is not available at present. In this study, we compare different algorithms of risk prediction in order to select the best one for constructing a biomarker-based risk score, PancRISK."
